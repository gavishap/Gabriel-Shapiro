# Orginization-Employee-Desktop-QTWidget
Made a desktop widget that can read a file with company information and output it in an organized widget window. Package is pip installable with "organization_cli" name. As well I used CLI entry points for easy command access.![image 63  (2)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71888304/167300904-6e0e715e-9cfd-4013-bce7-dfa5053dd462.png)
